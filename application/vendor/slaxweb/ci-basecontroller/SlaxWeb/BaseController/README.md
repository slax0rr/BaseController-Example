BaseController
==============

Base controller for CodeIgniter, helps you with loading views, subviews, and populating them with data and loading of language as well as injecting said languages into the view data.

The idea for the BaseController came from Jamie Rumbelows [base controller](https://github.com/jamierumbelow/codeigniter-base-controller), with some additions and changes. At this point I would also like to thank [Marco Monteiro](https://github.com/mpmont) and [Sami Kein√§nen](https://github.com/skope) for their help.

If you run into issues or have questions/ideas, please submit a ticket here on [GitHub](https://github.com/slax0rr/BaseController/issues).

This is still in development phase, but is production ready. All existing stuff will be there and if changes do occur, old ways will be kept around in deprecated state.

Install
=======

The easiest way to install at the moment is to use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
Simply create composer.json file in your project root:
```
{
  "require": {
    "slaxweb/ci-basecontroller": "~0.2"
  }
}
```

Then run **composer.phar install**. When finished, enable composer autoload in *application/config/config.php*.

Congratulations, BaseController is installed.

View loading and data
=====================

Example
-------
```PHP
<?php
class Contrlr extends \SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController
{
  public function showView()
  {
    // nothing, that's enough
    // base controller will load application/views/contrlr/showview/main.php view file
    // if the controller is located in a sub-dir, sub-dir is also included in view path
  }
  
  public function nonDefaultView()
  {
    $this->view = "path/to/different/view/file";
  }
  
  public function noView()
  {
    $this->view = false;
    // do whatever you want
  }
  
  public function subView()
  {
    $this->subViews = array("varName" => "subview/file");
  }
  
  public function viewWithData()
  {
    $this->viewData = array("name" => "value");
  }
}
```

Basic usage
-----------

To start using, all your controllers must extend **\SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController** instead of CI_Controller. If you are already extending MY_Controller, then extend **\SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController** in MY_Controller.

And this is it, after a controller method is done executing, BaseController will automatically load the view file associated with this controller method. The default view being loaded is: *application/views/(controllerdir)/controllername/controllermethod/main*.

Disable view loading
--------------------

Some controller methods do not load views. In this case set BaseController property **view** to false:
```PHP
$this->view = false
```

Change view file
----------------

Want to load a different view file and not the default one? No problem, just set the desired view file to **view** property.
```PHP
$this->view = "desired/view";
```

Load sub-views
--------------

If you need to load subviews into your main view, you can do so, by assigning an array to the BaseController **subViews** property. The key name in the array is later used as the var in the main view, and the value in the array is the sub-view file name. Controller code:
```PHP
$this->subViews = array("name" => "subview/file");
```

Main view:
```PHP
<?php echo $subview_name; ?>
```

View data
---------

To load data into view, simply assign it to the **viewData** property array.
```PHP
$this->viewData = array("name" => "value");
```

Controller 404 page
-------------------

If a controller method is not found, the Basecontroller will search in the routed-to controller a *_404* method and call it, so you can have custom 404 pages per controller. If it is not found, it will call the CodeIgniters *show_404* method, and the CodeIgniter 404 page will be displayed as per normal operation.

Languages
=========

BaseController also autoloads language files and loads properly prefixed language strings into the view data before loading the view. Language filename must have the same name as the controller, and all language strings that will be injected into the view data, need to have *methodname_* prefix in the language string key.

Example
-------

```PHP
<?php
class Contrlr extend \SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController
{
  public function injectLanguage()
  {
    // you're done, default view is loaded with default language and its prefixed language strings.
  }
  
  public function noLang()
  {
    $this->langFile = false;
  }
  
  public function diffLangFile()
  {
    $this->langFile = "Diffrent";
  }
  
  public function diffPrefix()
  {
    $this->langPrefix = "custom_prefix_";
  }
  
  public function nonDefaultLanguage()
  {
    $this->language = "german";
  }
}
```
Basic usage
-----------

By default, base controller will auto-load the language file that has the same name as the controller name, from the default language directory. By default that is english, changeable in CodeIgniter config. By default it will load all language strings which have the *methodname_* as the prefix in the language string key name.
```PHP
class Contrlr \SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController
{
  public function defaultLang()
  {
  }
}
```

Above will try to autoload **application/language/english/Contrlr_lang.php** and inject translated strings.
```PHP
$lang["defaultLang_var1"] = "string";
$lang["defaultLang_var2"] = "string";
$lang["defaultLang_var3"] = "string";
```

In the view, vars **$var1**, **$var2**, and **$var3**, will be available.

No languages
------------

To disable loading of languages, simply disable it by setting property **langFile** to false.
WARNING! Property used for disabling the language file loading in 0.1.* versions is **includeLang**!
```PHP
$this->langFile = false;
```

Language file
-------------

In order to load a different language file, set the **langFile** property.
```PHP
$this->langFile = "Different";
```
If you wish to load multiple language files, set an array with those language file names to the **langFile** property.
```PHP
$this->langFile = array("Lang1", "Lang2", "Lang3");
```

Language prefix
---------------
To change the prefix from the default method name, set the **langPrefix** property.
```PHP
$this->langPrefix = "langprefix_";
```

Non-Default language
--------------------
If you want to load a non-default language, you have to set it with the **language** property.
```PHP
$this->language = "german";
```

Templates
=========

Base controller also supports basic templating. At the moment only by setting a header and footer view.

Example
-------

```PHP
class Contrlr extends \SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController
{
  // DEPRECATED
  public function template()
  {
    $this->head = "head/view";
    $this->foot = "foot/view";
  }
  
  // DEPRECATED
  public function noTemplate()
  {
    // if a template is already loaded, you can disable it
    $this->include = false;
  }

  public function layout()
  {
    // to load a layout, set layout property to true
    // base controller will try to load the controllers layout if not found
    // it will load the application default layout
    $this->layout = true;
  }

  public function specificLayout()
  {
    // if you want your method or whole controller to have a specific
layout file you can set it to the layout property
    $this->layout = "layout/view";
  }
}
```

DEPRECATED - Setting template files
-----------------------------------

In order to set the header and/or footer files, properties **head**, and **foot** must be set. Then the header view will be loaded before the controller view(s), and the footer will come after.
```PHP
$this->head = "head/view";
$this->foot = "foot/view";
```

DEPRECATED - Disable template
-----------------------------

If you have set the template files, but would not like to display the header and footer views, you need to set the **include** property to false.
```PHP
$this->include = false;
```

Layout
------

Instead of header/footer files, BaseController now provides layouts. The
layout is the whole template and your controller view gets injected into
this layout view through the **mainView** variable. You have four
options:
* No layout (default), set BaseController **layout** property to false
* Controller specific layout, set property **layout** to true,
  BaseController will try to load the default controller layout file from {views}/layouts/ControllerDir/ControllerName/layout
* Application specific layout, set property **layout** to true, and make
  sure controller specific layout view file does not exists
* Custom layout, set the path to the layout view file to the **layout**
  property
```PHP
// use controller or application specific layout
$this->layout = true;
// use custom layout
$this->layout = 'layout/myLayout';
```

Manual view loading
===================

BasicController also allows you to manually load any view file you want. Because BaseController is using the [ViewLoader](https://github.com/slax0rr/ViewLoader), you can access it through the protected **_viewLoader** property. For help with using the ViewLoader, please read the readme [here](https://github.com/slax0rr/ViewLoader/blob/develop/README.md).

Models
======

BaseController now tries to auto-load the default model for this controller, which needs to have the same name as the controller it self, with the *_model* suffix. You can also add additional models you may want to load to the **models** property. Models are then accessible as $this->{Model name}, without the *_model* suffix.

Example
-------

```PHP
class Cntrlr extends \SlaxWeb\BaseController\BaseController
{
    // Autoload models Model1_model and Model2_model
    public $models = array("Model1", "Model2");

    public function someMethod()
    {
        // now just use the model:
        $this->Model1->modelMethod();
        $this->Model2->modelMethod();
    }
}
```

CRUD
====

CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete. BaseController provides basic CRUD methods that retrieve data, inject them into the view data as well as take post data for creation, update and deletion of database data. As long as your models provides the necessary methods for such operations. To be on the safe side, install the [BaseModel](https://github.com/slax0rr/BaseModel), and extend your model from it.

There are 4 methods for CRUD:
* index - fetches the data from the database and injects the BaseModel Result object into view data as **_tableData** variable
* update_post - takes the post data as well as an ID as the input parameter and updates the database table, if ID is int(0), then all records will be updated
* create_post - takes the post data and inserts it into the Table
* delete_post - takes the ID as input parameter and deletes the record. If ID is int(0) it deletes all records in the table

All but index(Create) are accessed through POST HTTP request method, and also all 3 provide a means to load a specific view after they have completed, and also set an error in view data if the operation was not successful. This is done through 3 different BaseController properties:
* afterUpdate
* afterCreate
* afterDelete

Those need to contain the string location of the view to be loaded. If left empty, the respective default view will be loaded as per methods HTTP GET request counterpart (update, create, delete).

Update and Create also provide a means for data validation, all you need to do is set a *createRules* or *updateRules* public properties in your controller. Those need to contain the normal CodeIgniter validation rules.

On error, Create, Update and Delete will inject the error strings as *createError*, *updateError* or *deleteError* variables. There are 3 types of errors: validation error, create error and update error, as well as a fourth, generic error for delete method. In order to get the message, your controller language file has to be loaded and it needs to contain following keys:
* error_validation_error - for when validation error occurs
* error_update_error - for when an update error occurs
* error_create_error - for when a create error occurs
* error_delete_generic - for when a delete error occurs

If those are set, you will get this error message in your view data. On validation errors you can normally use the CodeIgniter validation error printout as well.
